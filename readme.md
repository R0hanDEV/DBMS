## DBMS
1. What is Data?
        a. Data is a <span style="color:blue">*collection of raw, unorganized facts and details like text, observations, figures symbols,
        and descriptions of things etc.* </span>
        In other words, data does not carry any specific purpose and has no significance by itself.
        Moreover,  <span style="color:blue">*data is measured in terms of bits and bytes – which are basic units of information in the
        context of computer storage and processing.* </span>
        b. Data can be recorded and doesn’t have any meaning unless processed.
